## Scope and cost

Choose fixed fee or hourly rate.

### Hourly rate and estimate

Client instructed Firm to {{work scope}}.

Firm will charge Client professional fees for the work Firm does based on hourly rates. The hourly rates charged are {{hourly rate}}.

On Firm’s present instructions, Firm estimates the cost of the work to be {{total}} (exclusive of GST).

Please note that this is an estimate only and not a fixed quote. The total costs may exceed the estimate. While the estimate is based on present information and instructions and Firm’s current understanding from Client as to what services are required, Firm’s costs may exceed the estimate if further information becomes available or circumstances change which affect these matters. In this event Firm will provide Client with a revised estimate as soon as practicable. Where there is a significant change in Client’s matter then as far as possible Firm will advise the impact of the change on the legal costs.

Some of the variables which may affect and change the costs estimate include:
- the number and duration of telephone calls or other communications;
- Client’s prompt and efficient response to requests for information or instructions;
- whether Client’s instructions are varied;
- whether documents have to be revised in light of varied instructions;
- the lawyer or other persons with whom Firm deals and the level of co-operation of the lawyer’s clients and other persons involved;
- changes in the law; and
- the complexity or uncertainty concerning legal issues affecting Client’s matter.

### Fixed fee

Client instructs Firm to {{work scope}}.

Firm will charge Client professional fees for the work Firm does on a fixed fee basis in the amount of {{fixed fee amount}} (excluding GST).  The fixed fee quote assumes two revisions of the document only.

## Assumptions

The costs described in this document assume that both parties work together quickly and efficiently.  In describing costs in this document, Firm assumes that:

- work on a document will take no longer than **two weeks** (excluding holidays agreed in writing) - if work takes longer than that as a result of delays on the Client side, it is likely that there will be extra costs owing to the inefficiencies introduced by delays; and
- Client has a good broadband Internet connection that they can use to work with Firm.

## Disbursements

With Client’s permission, Firm may incur disbursements (being money which Firm pays or are liable to pay to others on Client’s behalf). Disbursements may include search fees, court filing fees, process server fees, expert fees, witness expenses, travel expenses, transcript expenses and barrister's fees.

Where Client instructs Firm to brief a barrister or other expert and they provide a disclosure and costs agreement Firm will provide this to Client.

## Billing Arrangements

Firm’s usual policy is to issue a tax invoice on a monthly basis but Firm may issue tax invoices on a more frequent basis depending on the nature of the work (including upon substantial completion of the work). All tax invoices are due and payable {{payment term}} from the date of the tax invoice. Client consents to Firm sending its tax invoices to Client electronically at Client’s usual email address as specified by Client.

## Acceptance of Offer

Client may accept the Agreement by:
- signing this document; or
- continuing to instruct Firm.

Upon acceptance Client agrees to pay for the services described by the Agreement.

## Interest Charges

Interest at the maximum rate prescribed in Rule 75 of the Uniform General Rules (being the Cash Rate Target set by the Reserve Bank of Australia plus 2%) will be charged on any amounts unpaid after the expiry of 30 days after a tax invoice is given to Client. Firm’s tax invoices will specify the interest rate to be charged.

## Recovery of Costs

The Uniform Law provides that Firm cannot take action for recovery of legal costs until 30 days after a tax invoice (which complies with the Uniform Law) has been given to Client.

## Client rights

It is Client’s right to:
- negotiate a costs agreement with Firm;
- negotiate the method of billing (eg task based or time based);
- request and receive an itemised bill within 30 days after a lump sum bill or partially itemised bill is payable;
- seek the assistance of the designated local regulatory authority (the NSW Commissioner) in the event of a dispute about legal costs;
- be notified as soon as is reasonably practicable of any significant change to any matter affecting costs;
- accept or reject any offer Firm makes for an interstate costs law to apply to Client’s matter; and
- notify Firm that Client requires an interstate costs law to apply to Client’s matter.

If Client requests an itemised bill and the total amount of the legal costs specified in it exceeds the amount previously specified in the lump sum bill for the same matter, the additional costs may be recovered by Firm only if:
- when the lump sum bill is given, Firm informs Client in writing that the total amount of the legal costs specified in any itemised bill may be higher than the amount specified in the lump sum bill; and
- the costs are determined to be payable after a costs assessment or after a binding determination under section 292 of the Uniform Law.

Nothing in the Agreement affects Client’s rights under the Australian Consumer Law.

## Client rights in a costs dispute

If Client has a dispute in relation to any aspect of Firm’s legal costs Client has the following avenues of redress:
- in the first instance Firm encourages Client to discuss its concerns with Firm so that any issue can be identified and Firm can have the opportunity of resolving the matter promptly and without it adversely impacting on the business relationship; and
- Client may apply to the Manager, Costs Assessment located at the Supreme Court of NSW for an assessment of Firm’s costs. This application must be made within 12 months after the bill was provided or request for payment made or after the costs were paid.

## Advance payment

It is Firm’s policy that, when acting for new clients, Firm does 1 or more of the following:
- approve credit;
- ask Client to pay monies into Firm’s trust account; or
- ask Client for their credit card details.

Unless otherwise agreed with Client, Firm may determine not to incur fees or expenses in excess of the amount that Firm holds in trust on Client’s behalf or for which credit is approved.

## Retention of documents

On completion of Firm’s work, or following termination (by either party) of Firm’s services, Firm will retain Client’s documents for 7 years. Client’s entry into the Agreement constitutes Client’s authority for Firm to destroy the file after those 7 years. The authority does not relate to any documents which are deposited in safe custody which will, subject to agreement, be retained on Client’s behalf indefinitely. Firm is entitled to retain Client’s documents while there is money owing to Firm for Firm’s costs.

Client will be liable for the cost of storing and retrieving documents in storage and Firm’s professional fees in connection with this.

## Firm termination

Firm may cease to act for Client or refuse to perform further work, including:
- while any of Firm’s tax invoices remain unpaid;
- if Client does not within 7 days comply with any request to pay an amount in respect of disbursements or future costs;
- if Client fails to provide Firm with clear and timely instructions to enable Firm to advance Client’s matter, for example, compromising Firm’s ability to comply with Court directions, orders or practice notes;
- if Client refuses to accept Firm’s advice;
- if Client indicates to Firm or Firm forms the view that Client has lost confidence in Firm;
- if there are any ethical grounds which Firm considers require Firm to cease acting for Client, for example a conflict of interest;
- for any other reason outside Firm’s control which has the effect of compromising Firm’s ability to perform the work required within the required timeframe;
- if in Firm’s sole discretion Firm considers it is no longer appropriate to act for Client; or
- for just cause.

Firm will give Client reasonable written notice of termination of Firm’s services. Client will be required to pay Firm’s costs incurred up to the date of termination.

## Client termination

Client may terminate Firm’s services by written notice at any time. However, if Client does so Client will be required to pay Firm’s costs incurred up to the date of termination (including if the matter is litigious, any cancellation fees or other fees such as hearing allocation fees for which Firm remains responsible).

## Lien

Without affecting any lien to which Firm is otherwise entitled at law over funds, papers and other property of Client’s:
- Firm will be entitled to retain by way of lien any funds, property or papers of Client’s, which are from time to time in Firm’s possession or control, until all costs, disbursements, interest and other moneys due to Firm have been paid; and
- Firm’s lien will continue notwithstanding that Firm ceases to act for Client.

## Privacy

Firm will collect personal information from Client in the course of providing its legal services. Firm may also obtain personal information from third party searches, other investigations and, sometimes, from adverse parties.

Firm is required to collect the full name and address of Clients by Rule 93 of the Uniform General Rules. Accurate name and address information must also be collected in order to comply with the trust account record keeping requirements of Rule 47 of the Uniform General Rules and to comply with Firm’s duty to the courts.

Personal information will only be used for the purposes for which it is collected or in accordance with the _Privacy Act_ 1988 (Cth). For example, Firm may use personal information to provide advice and recommendations that take into account Client’s personal circumstances.

If Client does not provide Firm with the full name and address information required by law Firm cannot act for Client. If Client does not provide Firm with the other personal information that Firm requests, Firm’s advice may be wrong for Client or misleading.

Depending on the nature of Client’s matter the types of bodies to whom Firm may disclose Client’s personal information include the courts, the other party or parties to litigation, experts and barristers, the Office of State Revenue, PEXA Limited, the Land and Property Information Division of the Department of Lands, the Registrar General and third parties involved in the completion or processing of a transaction.
